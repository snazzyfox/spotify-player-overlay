# Spotify Player Overlay

A simple, client side only "now playing" card that you can use to display what you're playing in Spotify in OBS. The overlay automatically disappears when your music is paused or stopped.

## How to use

To use this tool, simply go to [Github Pages for this Repo](https://snazzyfox.github.io/spotify-player-overlay/) and follow the steps there. It will generate a URL that you can add to your streaming tool.

### Customizing the player

Most themeing elements are in [CSS variables](/public/theme.css) declared in `:root`. If you'd like to change any of the colors and sizing options, you can override them in OBS.
